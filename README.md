# Pair programming

In this activity you will practice concepts and techniques related to semantic HTML and CSS. 

## Description

Your task is to complete the HTML and CSS for a basic static web page for Sweet Eats Bakery.

> [Review the provided design file for the menu page](design-files/screenshot.png "")

All of the text values have been provided in the HTML; you must create the structure of the page using semantic tags. Remember that semantic markup provides meaning.  Here are a few tags you could consider using:

h1 through h6<br />
p<br />
header<br />
footer<br />
nav<br />
a<br />
section<br />
address

Once you've completed the basic structure with HTML, you'll need to add some more style! Much of the stylesheet has already been completed, but there are comments where you'll need to fill in the blanks. Use the resources below to look up specific style properties and selectors.

## Project Set Up

1. Fork the repository, then clone from your fork.
5. cd into your repository on the command line and use `code .` to open VS Code.
6. Open the terminal in Vscode and type `npm install`. While this runs, click the split terminal icon.
7. Next type `npm run test` in one side, and use the other side for git commands or general use.
8. Download the Live Server extension from the Extensions tab on the left side of your VS Code. After it is done installing, click "Go Live" on the bottom right side of your screen to run your HTML file.
9. Complete your work making regular commits to the main branch

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:
 
* [ ] Create the HTML structure using semantic tags
* [ ] Fill in the blanks in the CSS

## Extra Task

Only attempt this task after you've successfully reached MVP. 

* [ ] Pick a navigation item and create a new page with the same header and footer as the home page; be creative and have fun coming up with your own unique content and styles
